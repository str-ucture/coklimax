The Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)
=======================================

Overview
--------

The Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) is a comprehensive online platform that provides access to a wide range of climate data and services. As part of the European Union's Copernicus programme, the CDS is designed to support users with high-quality data and information for analyzing, monitoring, and adapting to climate change. The platform and its content are available free of charge and are aimed at scientific and administrative professionals, as well as interested laypeople.

Features of the CDS
-------------------

The CDS database includes:

- Historical climate data
- Current observations
- Model forecasts

It covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Temperature
- Precipitation
- Wind conditions
- Sea level
- Greenhouse gas emissions
- And more

The data is obtained from various sources, such as:

- Satellite observations
- In situ measurements
- Numerical climate models

Additionally, the CDS provides access to **reanalyses**, which are homogenized and reinterpreted past climate data processed using modern models and techniques. These reanalyses enable a better understanding of long-term trends and patterns.

Applications and Benefits
-------------------------

The diverse resources offered by the Copernicus Climate Data Store are invaluable for decision-makers. They support informed decision-making to address the challenges of climate change and promote sustainable action.

**For Urban Decision-Makers**

The CDS provides essential data for proactively addressing the challenges posed by climate change. Key benefits include:

- **Risk Assessment**: Precise and up-to-date information on climate trends and extreme events, such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall, or floods, helps cities assess their climate risks.
- **Adaptation Strategies**: Facilitates the development of data-driven adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
- **Urban Planning**: Optimizes urban planning processes, such as:
  - Identifying heat islands
  - Planning climate-resilient infrastructure
  - Improving water management
- **Compliance**: Supports legal and international climate goals by providing a reliable data basis for reporting and sustainability strategies.

By leveraging CDS resources, cities can make informed decisions that promote sustainable development for current and future generations.
